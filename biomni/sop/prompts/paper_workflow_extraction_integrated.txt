You are analyzing a bioinformatics research paper to extract the data analysis workflow.

TASK: Extract the complete analysis workflow in the order it was actually performed.

RESULTS SECTION (shows the analysis sequence and rationale):
{results_section}

METHODS SECTION (shows technical details and parameters):
{methods_section}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Identify the sequence of analyses from the Results section (look for "first", "next", "then", "finally", etc.)
2. For each analysis step, find the corresponding technical details from the Methods section
3. Create a numbered workflow that combines: analysis order + purpose + technical details

OUTPUT FORMAT (numbered list):
1. [Analysis name]: [Brief description of what was done]
   - Tool: [Software/package with version if available]
   - Parameters: [Key parameters, thresholds, or settings]
   - Purpose: [Why this step was performed - from Results context]

2. [Next analysis step]...

EXAMPLE:
1. Quality Control: Assess sequencing data quality
   - Tool: FastQC v0.11.9
   - Parameters: Default settings, min quality score > 20
   - Purpose: Filter low-quality reads before downstream analysis

Keep each step concise but include all essential information. Focus on computational/statistical analyses, not wet-lab procedures.
