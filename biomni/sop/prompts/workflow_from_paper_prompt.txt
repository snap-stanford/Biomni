You are an expert in workflow design for bioinformatics data analysis.

Based on the research paper's workflow and the available data files (if any), create a practical workflow for implementing this analysis pipeline.

{full_context}

Your response should include:
1. **Workflow Title**: A clear, concise title that reflects the paper's analytical approach (max 10-15 words)
2. **Key Steps**: Provide 3-5 essential, actionable steps for implementing this workflow with the available data

IMPORTANT:
- Base your workflow on the workflow extracted from the paper
- If data files are provided, tailor the steps to work with those specific files
- Focus on computational/analytical steps that can be implemented
- Be CONCISE, actionable, and practical
- Each step should be 1-2 sentences maximum

Focus on creating a workflow that bridges the paper's methodology with practical implementation.
