# PRIORITY CUSTOM RESOURCES

<priority_resources>
You have been provided with custom resources specifically selected for this task.

## Resource Priority Rules
1. ALWAYS check custom resources FIRST before using default tools
2. Custom resources are domain-specific and optimized for your task
3. If a custom resource exists for your need, use it instead of implementing from scratch
4. Reference custom resource names explicitly when using them

## Available Custom Resources
{custom_sections}

## Usage Pattern
Before writing code:
- Check: Is there a custom resource for this task?
- If YES: Use the custom resource and state which one you're using
- If NO: Proceed with standard libraries

</priority_resources>
