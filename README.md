# Biomni: A General-Purpose Biomedical AI Agent

## Overview

Biomni is a general-purpose biomedical AI agent designed to autonomously execute a wide range of research tasks across diverse biomedical subfields. By integrating cutting-edge large language model (LLM) reasoning with retrieval-augmented planning and code-based execution, Biomni helps scientists dramatically enhance research productivity and generate testable hypotheses.

## Quick Start

### Installation

Our software environment is massive and we provide a single setup.sh script to setup.
Follow this [file](biomni_env/README.md) to setup the env first.

Then activate the environment E1:

```bash
conda activate biomni_e1
```

then install the latest biomni package:

```bash
pip install biomni --upgrade
```

Or install from the github source version.

Lastly, configure your API keys in bash profile `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY" # optional if you just use Claude
```

### Basic Usage

Once inside the environment, you can start using Biomni:

```python
from biomni.agent import A1

# Initialize the agent with data path, Data lake will be automatically downloaded on first run (~11GB)
agent = A1(path='./data', llm='claude-sonnet-4-20250514')

# Execute biomedical tasks using natural language
agent.go("Plan a CRISPR screen to identify genes that regulate T cell exhaustion, generate 32 genes that maximize the perturbation effect.")
agent.go("Perform scRNA-seq annotation at [PATH] and generate meaningful hypothesis")
agent.go("Predict ADMET properties for this compound: CC(C)CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(C)C(=O)O")
```

## 🤝 Contributing to Biomni

Biomni is an open-science initiative that thrives on community contributions. We welcome:

- **🔧 New Tools**: Specialized analysis functions and algorithms
- **📊 Datasets**: Curated biomedical data and knowledge bases
- **💻 Software**: Integration of existing biomedical software packages
- **📋 Benchmarks**: Evaluation datasets and performance metrics
- **📚 Misc**: Tutorials, examples, and use cases
- **🔧 Update existing tools**: many current tools are not optimized - fix and replacements are welcome!

Check out this **[Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTION.md)** on how to contribute to the Biomni ecosystem.

If you have particular tool/database/software in mind that you want to add, you can also submit to [this form](https://forms.gle/nu2n1unzAYodTLVj6) and the biomni team will implement them.

## 🔬 Call for Contributors: Help Build Biomni-E2

Biomni-E1 only scratches the surface of what’s possible in the biomedical action space.

Now, we’re building **Biomni-E2** — a next-generation environment developed **with and for the community**.

We believe that by collaboratively defining and curating a shared library of standard biomedical actions, we can accelerate science for everyone.

**Join us in shaping the future of biomedical AI agent.**

- **Contributors with significant impact** (e.g., 10+ significant & integrated tool contributions or equivalent) will be **invited as co-authors** on our upcoming paper in a top-tier journal or conference.
- **All contributors** will be acknowledged in our publications.
- More contributor perks...

Let’s build it together.

## Release schedule

- [ ] 8 Real-world research task benchmark/leaderboard release
- [ ] A tutorial on how to contribute to Biomni
- [ ] A tutorial on baseline agents
- [x] Biomni A1+E1 release

## ToolUniverse Integration

Biomni now supports integration with [ToolUniverse](https://github.com/mims-harvard/ToolUniverse), a large collection of community-maintained tools for LLM agents.

### Enabling ToolUniverse

1. Ensure `tooluniverse` is installed (see `biomni_env/environment.yml`).
2. Use the `ToolUniverseAgent` to access all ToolUniverse tools:

```python
from biomni.agent.tooluniverse_agent import ToolUniverseAgent
agent = ToolUniverseAgent(llm="gpt-4")
log, result = agent.go("tool_name", arg1=..., arg2=...)
print(result)
```

3. Or, include ToolUniverse tools in the main agent pipeline:

```python
from biomni.agent.a1 import A1
agent = A1(include_tooluniverse=True)
# Now ToolUniverse tools are available in the agent's tool registry and can be called as other tools.
```

### How it works
- ToolUniverse tools are loaded and registered via an adapter.
- You can call any ToolUniverse tool by name and arguments using the `.go()` method (ToolUniverseAgent) or as part of the main agent pipeline (A1 with `include_tooluniverse=True`).
- ToolUniverse tools can be optionally included in the main tool registry for other agents.

See the [ToolUniverse documentation](https://github.com/mims-harvard/ToolUniverse/blob/main/README_USAGE.md) for available tools and usage details.

## Note
- This release was frozen as of April 15 2025, so it differs from the current web platform.
- Biomni itself is Apache 2.0-licensed, but certain integrated tools, databases, or software may carry more restrictive commercial licenses. Review each component carefully before any commercial use.
