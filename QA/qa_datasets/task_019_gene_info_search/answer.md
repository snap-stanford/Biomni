# Answer: Gene Information - BRCA1

## Gene Symbol and Name
- **Symbol**: BRCA1
- **Full Name**: BRCA1 DNA repair associated

## Chromosomal Location
- **Chromosome**: 17
- **Cytogenetic location**: 17q21.31
- **Genomic coordinates**: chr17:43,044,295-43,125,482 (GRCh38)
- **Strand**: Plus strand

## Gene Function and Biological Role

### Primary Functions
1. **DNA Repair**: Plays a critical role in DNA double-strand break repair through homologous recombination
2. **Cell Cycle Control**: Regulates cell cycle checkpoints, particularly G1/S and G2/M transitions
3. **Transcriptional Regulation**: Acts as a transcriptional co-regulator
4. **Chromatin Remodeling**: Involved in chromatin structure maintenance

### Biological Processes
- DNA repair pathway
- Cell cycle checkpoint pathway
- Apoptosis pathway
- Fanconi anemia pathway

## Associated Diseases

### Primary Disease Association
- **Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome (HBOC)**

### Cancer Risks
- Increased risk of breast cancer (up to 80% lifetime risk)
- Increased risk of ovarian cancer (up to 40% lifetime risk)
- Increased risk of other cancers including:
  - Prostate cancer
  - Pancreatic cancer
  - Fallopian tube cancer

## Clinical Significance

BRCA1 mutations are associated with significantly increased cancer risk. Genetic testing is recommended for individuals with:
- Family history of breast or ovarian cancer
- Early-onset breast cancer
- Multiple primary cancers
- Known BRCA1 mutation in family

## Additional Information

- **Protein product**: BRCA1 protein
- **Transcript variants**: Multiple splice variants exist
- **Conservation**: Highly conserved across species
- **Expression**: Expressed in various tissues, highest in breast and ovary
