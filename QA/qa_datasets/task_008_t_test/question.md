# Task: Perform t-test for Two Groups

Perform an independent samples t-test to compare means between two groups.

## Input

Two groups of numerical data:
- Group 1: [10.5, 11.2, 10.8, 11.5, 10.9]
- Group 2: [9.2, 9.5, 9.0, 9.8, 9.3]

## Requirements

1. Perform an independent samples t-test
2. Report:
   - t-statistic
   - p-value
   - Degrees of freedom
   - Mean of each group
   - Standard deviation of each group
3. Interpret the results (significant or not, assuming α = 0.05)

## Expected Output Format

Provide:
- Test statistics (t-statistic, p-value, degrees of freedom)
- Descriptive statistics for each group
- Interpretation of results
