# Answer: t-test Results

## Descriptive Statistics

### Group 1
- **Mean**: 10.98
- **Standard deviation**: 0.38
- **Sample size**: 5

### Group 2
- **Mean**: 9.36
- **Standard deviation**: 0.31
- **Sample size**: 5

## t-test Results

- **t-statistic**: 7.89
- **p-value**: 0.00015
- **Degrees of freedom**: 7.6 (Welch's t-test, unequal variances)

## Interpretation

The t-test shows a **statistically significant difference** between the two groups (p < 0.05).

- Group 1 has a significantly higher mean (10.98) compared to Group 2 (9.36)
- The difference is 1.62 units
- With p = 0.00015 < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis that the means are equal
