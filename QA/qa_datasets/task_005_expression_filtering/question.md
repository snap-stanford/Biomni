I have a gene expression matrix file located at `input_data/expression_matrix.tsv`. It contains log2-transformed expression values.

I want to filter out low-expression genes. Please keep only the genes that have a log2 expression value greater than 1 in at least 20% of the samples.

After filtering, please tell me how many genes are remaining and save the filtered matrix to a file.
