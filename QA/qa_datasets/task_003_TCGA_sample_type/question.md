Here is a list of TCGA sample barcodes. I need to classify each of them as either "Tumor" or "Normal" based on the TCGA barcode format.

TCGA-38-7271-01A
TCGA-55-7914-01A
TCGA-55-6978-11A
TCGA-38-4626-11A
TCGA-95-7043-01A
TCGA-55-6986-11A

Please provide a summary showing the total count for each type and a table with the classification results.
