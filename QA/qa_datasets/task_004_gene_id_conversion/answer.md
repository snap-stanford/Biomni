# Answer: Gene ID Conversion Results

## Conversion Results

| Ensembl ID | Gene Symbol |
|------------|-------------|
| ENSG00000000003 | TSPAN6 |
| ENSG00000000005 | TNMD |
| ENSG00000000419 | DPM1 |
| ENSG00000000457 | SCYL3 |
| ENSG00000000460 | C1orf112 |

## Summary

- **Total input IDs**: 5
- **Successfully mapped**: 5 (100%)
- **Failed to map**: 0

The conversion was performed using annotation databases that provide mappings between Ensembl IDs and Gene Symbols. Some Ensembl IDs may not have corresponding Gene Symbols (will be NA), and the mapping is based on current annotation databases and may change over time.
