# Answer: Boxplot for Group Comparison

## Summary Statistics by Group

| Group | Mean | Median | Std Dev | Min | Max |
|-------|------|--------|---------|-----|-----|
| Group A | 10.98 | 10.9 | 0.38 | 10.5 | 11.5 |
| Group B | 9.36 | 9.3 | 0.31 | 9.0 | 9.8 |
| Group C | 11.94 | 12.0 | 0.30 | 11.5 | 12.3 |

## Plot Description

The boxplot shows clear differences between the three groups:
- **Group C** has the highest median value (~12.0)
- **Group A** has intermediate values (~10.9)
- **Group B** has the lowest values (~9.3)

## Interpretation

- **Group differences**: Clear separation between groups indicates significant differences
- **Variability**: Box height shows within-group variability
- **Outliers**: Individual points beyond whiskers may indicate unusual values
- **Distribution shape**: Box position relative to whiskers indicates skewness
