I have survival data and gene expression values in `input_data/survival_data.tsv`.

I want to see if the expression level of the gene affects patient survival. Please split the patients into "High" and "Low" expression groups based on the median expression value.

Perform a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and a log-rank test to compare the two groups. Plot the survival curves and save it as `survival_plot.png`.
