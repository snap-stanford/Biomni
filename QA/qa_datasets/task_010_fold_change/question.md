# Task: Calculate Log2 Fold Change

Calculate the log2 Fold Change (log2FC) between two groups.

## Input

Mean expression values for two groups (already **log2-transformed**):
- Group 1 (Tumor) mean: 12.5
- Group 2 (Normal) mean: 10.3

## Requirements

1. Calculate log2 Fold Change
2. Interpret the result:
   - Is the gene up-regulated or down-regulated?
   - What is the fold change in linear scale?
3. Explain the formula and calculation

## Expected Output Format

Provide:
- Log2FC value
- Interpretation (up/down regulation)
- Fold change in linear scale
- Brief explanation
