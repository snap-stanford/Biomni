I have DEG analysis results in `input_data/deg_results.tsv`.

Could you create a Volcano plot to visualize these results? Use log2FoldChange for the x-axis and -log10(p-value) for the y-axis.

Please highlight significant genes (padj < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1) in different colors (e.g., Red for Up, Blue for Down). Save the image as `volcano_plot.png`.
