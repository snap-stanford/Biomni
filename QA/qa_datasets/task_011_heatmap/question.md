Using the expression matrix in `input_data/expression_matrix.tsv`, please generate a clustered heatmap.

The samples ending in `-01A` are Tumor and `-11A` are Normal. I'd like to visualize the expression patterns with hierarchical clustering on both genes and samples. Please include a color bar to distinguish the sample groups. Save the plot as `heatmap.png`.
