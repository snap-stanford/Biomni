# Answer: BRCA1 Gene Information

## Gene Symbol and Name
- **Symbol**: BRCA1
- **Full Name**: BRCA1 DNA repair associated

## Chromosomal Location
- **Chromosome**: 17
- **Location**: 17q21.31
- **Genomic Coordinates**: chr17:43,044,295-43,125,482 (GRCh38)

## Associated Diseases
- **Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome (HBOC)**
- Increased risk of breast cancer (up to 80% lifetime risk)
- Increased risk of ovarian cancer (up to 40% lifetime risk)
- Increased risk of other cancers including prostate, pancreatic, and fallopian tube cancers

## Key Functions
1. **DNA Repair**: Plays a critical role in DNA double-strand break repair through homologous recombination
2. **Cell Cycle Control**: Regulates cell cycle checkpoints, particularly G1/S and G2/M transitions
3. **Transcriptional Regulation**: Acts as a transcriptional co-regulator
4. **Chromatin Remodeling**: Involved in chromatin structure maintenance

## Pathways
- DNA repair pathway
- Cell cycle checkpoint pathway
- Apoptosis pathway
- Fanconi anemia pathway

## Clinical Significance
BRCA1 mutations are associated with significantly increased cancer risk, and genetic testing is recommended for individuals with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer.
