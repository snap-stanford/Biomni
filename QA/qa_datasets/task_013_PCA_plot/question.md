Perform a PCA analysis on the expression data in `input_data/expression_matrix.tsv`.

I want to see if the Tumor (`-01A`) and Normal (`-11A`) samples separate well. Please create a 2D PCA scatter plot (PC1 vs PC2) with samples colored by their group. Also, let me know how much variance is explained by the first two components. Save the plot as `pca_plot.png`.
